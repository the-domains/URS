# URBAN RIDER SOCIETY

## As a Motorcycle & Scooter rider, we feel we  belong to a big community, and that sensation gives us something in common; we share a bond that sets us apart from the rest of the motoring community.

To a URS member, motorcycling is not a mere hobby or a pastime.  It is the very breath of life itself.  It is a revelation and a blessing.  

Riding a motorcycle is the greatest thing a person can do, short of maybe saving orphans from a forest fire or curing cancer. 

Motorcycling is a means and an end and a reason and an excuse and a validation for the human condition. 

And we at URS, because we are motorcyclists, know we're pretty special. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9d3cb37c-8f38-4832-9db5-ed4836a44c17.jpg)
