# URBAN RIDER SOCIETY

## As a Motorcycle & Scooter rider, we feel we  belong to a big community, and that sensation gives us something in common; we share a bond that sets us apart from the rest of the networking community.

Urban Rider Society is an celebration of the motorcycling community, it shares the passion of motorcycle riding and shows the camaraderie of the friends and families who ride together.  

URS is for racers, riders, pioneers, parents, young, old in the riding community.

URS is for the everyday of motorcyclists & scooter rider who live each day to the fullest on their two-wheeled machines.  

We recognise the motorcycling and Scooter community and we bring brands and riders together to celebrate about the joys of motorcycling through the recognition of the value of the riding community.

We bring value to the URS member.  We ensure that others in the community recognise the value of the rider community too.
